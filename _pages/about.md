I am a [development economist](https://www.wider.unu.edu/expert/michael-danquah?page=1) with more than twelve years of experience in research and teaching in economic development and policy issues in sub-Saharan Africa. I am a co-chair of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population (IUSSP) Scientific Panel on Population, Inequality and Climate Change. Previously, I worked as a [Research fellow at UNU WIDER](https://www.wider.unu.edu/expert/michael-danquah?page=1). I was the lead for three of the institute’s flagship work programmes, as well as the country programme in Myanmar. 

My extensive research work has focused largely on issues related to inclusive green growth, informality and labour market in African countries, structural transformation in African cities, productivity growth among others. I am also interested in applying probabilistic machine learning methods to study development economic issues.

My research has been published in peer reviewed journals such as Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, Journal of Development Studies, Small Business Economics, Journal of African Economies, and Energy Economics among others. I have co-edited a journal special issue in the Journal of Development Studies that looks at what sustains informality? Working with Gary Fields and others, I have also co-edited a book volume titled ‘ The Job Ladder: Transforming Informal Work and Livelihoods in Developing Countries, published by Oxford University Press, UK. This influential book attempts to reconceptualize the informal labour market in developing countries through the introduction of a tiered view to informality. I have published many working papers, policy briefs and influential blogs focusing on salient issues in Africa such as informality, economic transformation, climate and private sector development, sub national institutional performance among many others. 
I have been awarded the Most Promising Young Scholar and Best Researcher in the School of Social Sciences, University of Ghana, Legon, Ghana.

I have also been interviewed by the BBC World Service on issues related to poverty reduction as well as the pandemic effects of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa.
